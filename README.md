Our project uses sensors to find points in the real world enviorment and maps them to a 3D enviorment.

It uses a sound distance sensor, accelerometer and gyroscope to take orienation and distance values from the real world to map them into the 3D enviorment.
Using the points found we are also able to detect objects in the real world and draw them into the 3D enviorment from the sensors orientation.
